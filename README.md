## Description
Regex crossword is a type of puzzle where the crossword clues are regular expressions instead of traditional clues. The goal is to find the character which satisfies the regular expressions of that row and column. In our app we are going to have at least three levels of difficulty (easy, medium, and hard).  Puzzles can be in a variety of sizes with different number of rows and columns based on the difficulty level of the puzzle. The tables below show an example of an easy and a more difficult regex crossword. Regex crosswords can also be in hexagonal forms like in figure one below. Each difficulty level will have a set of different puzzles that users will progress through. The app will also include a basic tutorial that will show unfamiliar users what a regex crossword is.
